/**
 * WHY THIS FILE IS `.cjs` INSTEAD OF `.js`
 * ----------------------------------------
 * This file must use `.cjs` (CommonJS module syntax) because:
 * - The New Relic Node.js agent is a CommonJS-only module.
 * - If your project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json (like with Next.js + App Router),
 *   then `.js` files are treated as ESM, which will break when New Relic tries to `require()` this file.
 *
 * Using `.cjs` guarantees compatibility with New Relicâ€™s internal config loader,
 * which expects CommonJS syntax.
 *
 * Your `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` should be an account API key, with the "Type" set to "INGEST - LICENSE".
