# Example instrumentation of a simple module

This example application shows you how to use the [newrelic.instrument](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/API.html#instrument) and [shim.record](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/Shim.html#record) API. This API allows you to instrument virtually any module that New Relic does not already support. In this example, we will instrument a simple module, a rudimentary job queue (`jobQueue`) that schedules and runs a series of basic jobs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Navigate to this example's sub directory
   ```
   cd newrelic-node-examples/custom-instrumentation/instrument
   ```
3. Install dependencies and run application.
   ```
   npm install
   cp env.sample .env
   # Fill out `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` in .env and save 
   # Start the application
   npm start
   ```
4. The app will automatically start adding example jobs to a queue and run them. You should see the following in the console when the instrumentation takes place.
   ```
   [NEWRELIC] instrumenting 'job-queue'
   Callback job done
   Promise job done
   ```

## Exploring Telemetry

1. After a few minutes, you should be able to see `job-queue` instrumented in New Relic. From the dashboard, navigate to 'APM & Services' and then select the 'Example Job Queue App' entity.
2. Then select 'Distributed tracing'. You should see the trace groups `firstTransacation`, `secondTransaction`, and `thirdTransaction`. Inside these groups will be our custom instrumentation. Select any trace group and then select a single trace.
3. Under `firstTransaction` or `secondTransaction`, toggle 'Show in-process spans' and you will see 'scheduleJob - job'; this shows the name of which job was recorded. Under `thirdTransaction`, you will see `queue.runJobs` instrumented as 'runJobs'.

## Description

This application consists of the following files:

* `index.js`: a simple app that utilizes our example module
* `job-queue.js`: an example module that provides a queue class that you can use to run and schedule jobs
* `instrumentation.js`: all of the New Relic instrumentation is in here; the `npm start` command makes sure this module is loaded first
* `newrelic.js`: a basic, sample New Relic configurartion
