// To add instrumentation to a web framework, you supply a single function 
// which is responsible for telling New Relic which framework methods 
// should be instrumented and what metrics and data to collect. The agent 
// calls this instrumentation function automatically when the web framework 
// module is required in the user's code. The function must be registered 
// with the agent by calling instumentWebframework.

  absolutePath: frameworkPath,

// The instrumentation function can be included in the application 
// code itself or it can live in a separate instrumentation module. 
// In either case, we need to register it in our application code 
// in order for the agent to use it.
//
// In this example, we are defining in here.

  // There are two API functions related to middleware - 
  // `recordMiddleware` and `wrapMiddlewareMounter`. Based on our 
  // SimpleFramework code, we will record a middleware
  // metric for the authentication middleware, and also for the 
  // endpoint middleware that responds to a specific request.
  //
  // We will use the `wrapMiddlewareMounter `method to wrap `all` 
  // and `get`. The third argument in that call is the spec where 
  // we tell the instrumentation which argument is the route path, 
  // and what to do with all other arguments that represent the 
  // middleware functions. The instrumentation will call the `wrapper` 
  // function for each middleware function, and here we need to wrap 
  // the original function and return the wrapped version of it.

      // original middleware function as the first argument, and a 
      // spec describing the middleware function signature. The 
      // `req`, `res`, and `next`parameters tell the instrumentation 
      // which arguments are which. The `route `and `type` arguments
      // are used for correctly naming the middleware metrics.

  // SimpleFramework has a function called render that takes the name
  // of a view and a callback. The callback returns the generated content.

  // recordRender.
  //
  // Note that in some cases (e.g. in Express) the `render` function may 
  // be directly on the `req` object and may be invoked without accepting a
  // callback. In this case calling the `render` function could be ending 
  // the HTTP response itself. In such a case, in order to capture correct 
  // timing for the render function, additional instrumentation would be 
  // needed based on how the web framework is implemented.
