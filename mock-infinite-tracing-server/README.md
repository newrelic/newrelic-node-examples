# Mock Infinite Tracing gRPC Server

This is a gRPC server used to test our [infinite tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing/) with the Node.js agent.


## Setup

To setup gRPC, run

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```

## Test

Once the gPRC server is started, you can use it in an example application and set the following in `newrelic.js`


```js
exports.config = {
    license_key: <your-license-key>,
    infinite_tracing: {
        trace_observer: {
            host: 'localhost',
            port: 50051,
            insecure: true
        },
        span_events: {
            force_capture_trace: true
        }
    }
}
```

As you use the application the mock gPRC server will log to console the number of spans seen.

## Testing errors
You can have the mock server respond with an error every n calls.  The agent has client retries built in and this can verify it is working. Below is an example that fails every 10th call:

```sh
NR_FAILS=true NR_FAIL_N_CALLS=10 node index.js
```
